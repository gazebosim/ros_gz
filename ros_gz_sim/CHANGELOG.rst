* Merge pull request `#670 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/670>`_ from gazebosim/ahcorde/jazzy/bp/663
  [backport Jazzy] Improve argument parsing in Actions (`#663 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/663>`_)
* Fix linter errors
* Improve argument parsing in Actions
  The `RosGzBridge` and `GzServer` now support different spellings for
  boolean arguments (`True`, `true`). This also simplifies how
  conditionals are used to create composable nodes by evaluating the
  conditionals and using them as regular Python booleans instead of
  relying on `PythonExpression`. It was actually the `PythonExpression`
  that was preventing support of boolean arguments spelled `true`/`false`.
* Set env path (`#659 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/659>`_) (`#661 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/661>`_)

1.0.7 (2024-11-08)
------------------
* Bugfix: `if "false"` is always `True` (`#617 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/617>`_) (`#640 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/640>`_)
  There is an issue in this launch file when passing the string 'false' as
  an argument. In Python, non-empty strings are always evaluated as True,
  regardless of their content. This means that even if you pass 'false',
  the system will still evaluate it as True.
  This bug results in the launch system incorrectly calling the OnShutdown
  method twice. When any ROS launch action invokes a RosAdapter, it
  triggers the following exception: "Cannot shutdown a ROS adapter that is
  not running."
  To temporarily work around this issue, you can launch gz_sim_launch.py
  with the on_exit_shutdown argument set to an empty string. This prevents
  the erroneous shutdown sequence and avoids the associated exception.
