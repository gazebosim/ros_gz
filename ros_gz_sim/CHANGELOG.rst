0.244.14 (2024-04-08)
---------------------
* Support `<gazebo_ros>` in `package.xml` exports (`#492 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/492>`_)
  This copies the implementation from `gazebo_ros_paths.py` to provide a
  way for packages to set resource paths from `package.xml`.
  ```
  e.g.  <export>
  <gazebo_ros gazebo_model_path="${prefix}/models"/>
  <gazebo_ros gazebo_media_path="${prefix}/models"/>
  </export>
  ```
  The value of `gazebo_model_path` and `gazebo_media_path` is appended to `GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH`
  The value of `plugin_path` appended to `GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH`
