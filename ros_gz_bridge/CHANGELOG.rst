Changelog for package ros_gz_bridge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.0.0 (2024-07-22)
------------------
* Making use_composition true by default (`#578 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/578>`_)
* Contributors: Addisu Z. Taddese

1.0.1 (2024-07-03)
------------------
* Add support for gz.msgs.EntityWrench (base branch: ros2) (`#573 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz//issues/573>`_)
* Merge pull request `#571 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz//issues/571>`_ from azeey/jazzy_to_ros2
  Merge jazzy ➡️  ros2
* Merge branch 'ros2' into jazzy_to_ros2
* Use memcpy instead of std::copy when bridging images (`#565 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz//issues/565>`_)
  While testing ros <-> gz communication using the bridge I noticed that the bridge was talking quite a bit of time copying images from Gazebo to ROS. I found that the std::copy operation that we're doing is substantially slower than the memcpy alternative. I think that in principle this shouldn't happen but the numbers are quite clear. Perhaps std::copy is doing something that doesn't use cache effectively
