1.0.8 (2025-01-14)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#670 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/670>`_ from gazebosim/ahcorde/jazzy/bp/663
  [backport Jazzy] Improve argument parsing in Actions (`#663 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/663>`_)
* Fix linter errors
* Improve argument parsing in Actions
  The `RosGzBridge` and `GzServer` now support different spellings for
  boolean arguments (`True`, `true`). This also simplifies how
  conditionals are used to create composable nodes by evaluating the
  conditionals and using them as regular Python booleans instead of
  relying on `PythonExpression`. It was actually the `PythonExpression`
  that was preventing support of boolean arguments spelled `true`/`false`.
* Fix use_respawn argument causing errors (`#651 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/651>`_) (`#654 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/654>`_)

1.0.4 (2024-08-29)
------------------
* feat: `override_timestamps_with_wall_time` parameter (backport `#562 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/562>`_) (`#584 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/584>`_)
  Co-authored-by: Rein Appeldoorn <rein.appeldoorn@nobleo.nl>
* Use memcpy instead of std::copy when bridging images (`#565 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/565>`_) (`#585 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/585>`_)
  While testing ros <-> gz communication using the bridge I noticed that the bridge was talking quite a bit of time copying images from Gazebo to ROS. I found that the std::copy operation that we're doing is substantially slower than the memcpy alternative. I think that in principle this shouldn't happen but the numbers are quite clear. Perhaps std::copy is doing something that doesn't use cache effectively
