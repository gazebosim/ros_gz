# Integration between ROS and Ignition

## Packages

This repository holds packages that provide integration between
[ROS](http://www.ros.org/) and [Ignition](https://ignitionrobotics.org):

* [ros_ign](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ros_ign/tree/ros2/ros_ign):
  Metapackage which provides all the other packages.
* [ros_ign_image](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ros_ign/tree/ros2/ros_ign_image):
  Unidirectional transport bridge for images from
  [Ignition Transport](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/transport)
  to ROS using
  [image_transport](http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport).
* [ros_ign_bridge](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ros_ign/tree/ros2/ros_ign_bridge):
  Bidirectional transport bridge between
  [Ignition Transport](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/transport)
  and ROS.
* [ros_ign_gazebo](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ros_ign/tree/ros2/ros_ign_gazebo):
  Convenient launch files and executables for using
  [Ignition Gazebo](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/gazebo)
  with ROS.
* [ros_ign_gazebo_demos](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ros_ign/tree/ros2/ros_ign_gazebo_demos):
  Demos using the ROS-Ignition integration.
* [ros_ign_point_cloud](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ros_ign/tree/ros2/ros_ign_point_cloud):
  Plugins for publishing point clouds to ROS from
  [Ignition Gazebo](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/gazebo) simulations.

## Install

This branch supports ROS Rolling. See above for other ROS versions.

### Binaries

Rolling binaries are available for Fortress.
They are hosted at https://packages.ros.org.

1. Add https://packages.ros.org

        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-latest.list'
        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo apt-get update

1. Install `ros_ign`

        sudo apt install ros-rolling-ros-ign

### From source

#### ROS

Be sure you've installed
[ROS Rolling](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/)
(at least ROS-Base). More ROS dependencies will be installed below.

#### Ignition

Install either [Edifice or Fortress](https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs).

Set the `IGNITION_VERSION` environment variable to the Ignition version you'd
like to compile against. For example:

    export IGNITION_VERSION=edifice

> You only need to set this variable when compiling, not when running.

#### Compile ros_ign

The following steps are for Linux and OSX.

1. Create a colcon workspace:

    ```
    # Setup the workspace
    mkdir -p ~/ws/src
    cd ~/ws/src

    # Download needed software
    git clone https://github.com/osrf/ros_ign.git -b ros2
    ```

1. Install dependencies (this may also install Ignition):

    ```
    cd ~/ws
    rosdep install -r --from-paths src -i -y --rosdistro rolling
    ```

    > If `rosdep` fails to install Ignition libraries and you have not installed them before, please follow [Ignition installation instructions](https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs/latest/install).

1. Build the workspace:

    ```
    # Source ROS distro's setup.bash
    source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash

    # Build and install into workspace
    cd ~/ws
    colcon build
    ```
