* Add node component and yaml-configured bridge node (`#238 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/238>`_)
  * Refactor in support of adding yaml-configured node
* Add rssi to Dataframe.msg (`#249 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/249>`_)
  * Adding rssi field to ros_ign_interfaces/Dataframe.msg
* Use the python generator for tests as well (`#234 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/234>`_)
  * Use the python generator for tests as well
* Generate boilerplate files from Python scripts (`#233 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/233>`_)
  The way that we add factories can be a bit error-prone, as there are a lot of strings that cannot be checked at compilation time. This changes several of the boilerplate files to be generated automatically by python scripts, in line with how ros1_bridge does it.
* [galactic] Backport GuiCamera, StringVec, TrackVisual, VideoRecord (`#241 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/241>`_)
  * [ros_ign_interfaces] Add more interface definitions.
  * Add converion functions for the added messages
  * Update the factory factory function with the new messages
  * Add new messages to docs
  * Add test cases for the new messages conversions

* Add Dataframe message and bridging (`#239 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/239>`_)
* Factory interface needs virtual destructor (`#232 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/232>`_)
* Optional "lazy" bridge subscribers (`#225 <https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/225>`_)
  This allows for the bridge to be created in such a way that it is "lazy". In this case "lazy" means:
  * The publication (output) side of the bridge is always on and actively looking for subscriptions.
  * The subscription (input) side of the bridge is only turned on in the case that there are subscriptions on the output side.
