  This PR fixes an incorrect subscription on one of the demos. Running
  ```
  ros2 launch ros_gz_sim_demos gpu_lidar_bridge.launch.py
  ```
  causes rviz2 to crash and exit with the error:
  ```
  rviz2-3]
  [rviz2-3] >>> [rcutils|error_handling.c:108] rcutils_set_error_state()
  [rviz2-3] This error state is being overwritten:
  [rviz2-3]
  [rviz2-3]   'create_subscription() called for existing topic name rt/lidar with incompatible type sensor_msgs::msg::dds\_::PointCloud2\_, at ./src/subscription.cpp:146, at ./src/rcl/subscription.c:108'
  [rviz2-3]
  [rviz2-3] with this new error message:
  [rviz2-3]
  [rviz2-3]   'invalid allocator, at ./src/rcl/subscription.c:218'
  [rviz2-3]
  [rviz2-3] rcutils_reset_error() should be called after error handling to avoid this.
  ```
  This is due to an incorrect subscription on the part of the demo. This
  PR fixes it by getting a subscription to the right topic for the
  pointcloud display. (`lidar/points` instead of `lidar`). Was tested on
  garden + humble.
